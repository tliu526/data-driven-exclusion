# Data-driven exclusion criteria for instrumental variables

Code repository for Data-driven exclusion criteria for instrumental variable studies [[OpenReview link]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fW60Hu9yDve) to appear in [CLeaR 2022](https://www.cclear.cc/2022).

Project structure:

~~~
figures/        Figures for submission
notebooks/      Notebooks to generate plots
results/        Simulation results
scripts/        Scripts used for diabetes case study
utils/          Utility functions for simulations, power calculations
~~~

We note that we cannot share the data for the diabetes fuzzy RDD case study,
so notebooks `03` and `04` will not run and are shared for informational 
purposes only.
